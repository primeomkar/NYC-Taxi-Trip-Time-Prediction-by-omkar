The NYC Taxi Trip Duration project is a machine learning regression model that aims to predict the duration of a taxi trip in New York City based on various input features such as the pickup and dropoff locations, the time of day, and the distance of the trip. The goal of the project is to improve the efficiency and convenience of taxi services by providing more accurate estimates of trip duration for both passengers and drivers.

The project utilizes historical data on taxi trips in NYC, including information on pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and trip distances. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and to convert categorical variables such as the pickup and dropoff locations into numerical values. Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract additional information from the data, such as the day of the week, the time of day, and the distances between locations.

The model was trained using a variety of regression algorithms such as linear regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the performance of the model. Model evaluation was performed using metrics such as mean absolute error and R-squared. The final model chosen was the LightGBM Regression model which performed the best among the models.

The model was then tested using a hold-out test set and was able to make predictions with a high level of accuracy. The results showed that the model was able to predict the duration of a taxi trip with an average error of less than 10 minutes.

The project also explores the important features that influence the duration of a taxi trip. The results showed that the pickup and dropoff locations, the time of day, and the distance of the trip are the most important factors that determine the duration of a taxi trip.

Overall, the NYC Taxi Trip Duration project successfully developed a machine learning regression model that is able to predict the duration of a taxi trip in New York City with a high level of accuracy. The model can be used by taxi companies to improve the efficiency and convenience of their services by providing more accurate estimates of trip duration for both passengers and drivers. It can also be used by passengers to plan their trip and make more informed decisions.

In future the model can be improved by incorporating other data sources such as weather data, traffic data, and other transportation data. Additionally, the model could be integrated with a real-time mapping and routing service to provide real-time estimates of trip duration based on current traffic conditions
